**Add sample data to patients, which are shown in cBioPortal in form of the table** (see image on the right.)
If you are new to cbpManager, we strongly advise you to take the tour with the `? tour` button above.
The first three blue rows of the table below represents the meta data of columns and contain a **short name**  (1st row), a **longer name** (2nd row), and the **data type** of the column. These rows are required by cBioPortal. Usually, you don't need to change them, but if you need to, you can edit them with the `Edit sample` button.

#### Edit table:

- **Add sample:** opens a dialog window with input fields per column of the table.
- **Edit sample:** select a row by clicking on it and then click on 'Edit patient' to edit the values in this row.
- **Delete sample:** select a row by clicking on it and then click on 'Delete sample' to delete the selected entry.
- **Add column(s):** after clicking on 'Add column' choose whether you want to add a pre-defined column or create a custom column. In case of a custom column, you need to provide a 'column name', a 'short name' and a 'long name' for this column.
- **Delete column(s):** choose the columns you want to delete.
- **Save:** saves the edited table to the final file.
