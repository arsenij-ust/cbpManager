#### Required columns

- The first column **'PATIENT_ID'** is **obligatory** and contains patient identifier. (Please do not override the cells containing 'Patient Identifier' and 'Patient identifier' in the first column.) 
- The second column **'SAMPLE_ID'** is also **required** and contains a unique sample identifier.

By adding 'PATIENT_ID' here, cBioPortal will map the given sample to this patient. This enables one to associate multiple samples to one patient. For example, a single patient may have had multiple biopsies, each of which has been genomically profiled.
